    <h2>Key Events</h2>
    <div class="main_text">
    <p>Sand Creek Massacre (1864): U.S. troops attacked a 
        peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho camp in Colorado, 
        killing many women and children. The event caused 
        national outrage and a government investigation, 
        but it led to increased military control rather 
        than protection for Native peoples.</p>

    <p>Great Sioux War (1865–1867): Plains tribes fought to 
        defend their land against U.S. expansion along the 
        Bozeman Trail. The conflict was costly for the 
        government and resulted in temporary treaties, like the
         Treaty of Fort Laramie, which briefly recognized 
         Sioux land rights.</p>

    <p>Impact on Government Policy: These events influenced U.S. policy 
        toward Native nations, relying more on military force
         and using treaties to clear land for settlers. 
         They helped establish the reservation system 
         and long-term federal control over Native affairs.</p>
