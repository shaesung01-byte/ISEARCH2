    <h2>Key Events</h2>
    <div class="main_text">
        <p>In The Sand Creek Massacre of 1864 U.S. Troops attacted a peacefull Cheyenne
        and Arapaho Camp in Colorado, Killing lots of women and children. This bloody 
        event caused much national outrage and government investigation but also increased military
        control over the indians rather than protection for native Americans</p>
    
        <p>In the Great Sioux War (1865-1867): plains tribes fought against U.S. expansion
            along the Boxeman Trail. This conflict was costly for the government
            and it resulted in temporary treaties such as the Treaty of Fort
            Laramie, which although briefly recognized Sioux land rights.
        </p>

         <p>These events had a significant impact on U.S. policy toward natives 
            as it set a standard for the U.S. to rely heavily on military force in order to force 
            tribes to set treaties to clear land for settlers. These events also helped establish
            the reservation system and long term federal control over Native American life.
