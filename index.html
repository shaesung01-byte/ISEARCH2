        <h2>Background</h2>

            
        <p>The sand creek massacare (1864) and the Great Sioux war (1865-1867)
            revealed the growing tension between the westward expansion of the U.S.
            and Native American sovereignty. In the Sand Creek Massacare, U.S. troops
            killed hundreds of Cheyenne and Arapaho people, which shocked the nation when
            the new leaked and led to a congressional investigation. In the investigation although
            only a few U.S. officials were reprimanded the event revealed the failures of federal
            policy towards natives.

            Unfortunately instead of lasting change in the following years the U.S. 
            begain to increasingly rely on military force in order to forcibly take land from
            natives instead of peacibly coming to settlements or coeixisting with them to get land
            for settlment and railroads. Additionally, even after the U.S. would force the 
            natives to sign unfair treaties with military pressure they would often
            go back on these treaties to get land.
