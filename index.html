        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            The Sand Creek Massacre (1864) and the Great Sioux War (1865/1867) 
            exposed the growing conflict between U.S. westward expansion and 
            Native American sovereignty. The Sand Creek Massacre, in which U.S. 
            troops killed hundreds of Cheyenne and Arapaho people, shocked the 
            nation and led to a congressional investigation. While few officials were 
            held accountable, the event revealed serious failures in federal Indian policy 
            and briefly raised calls for reform.

            Instead of lasting change, the years that followed saw increased reliance 
            on military force. During the Great Sioux War, the U.S. government
             repeatedly violated treaties and used armed conflict to secure land 
             for settlers and railroads. Together, these events pushed government 
             policy away from negotiation and toward coercion and confinement, 
             shaping U.S.–Native relations on the Great Plains for decades.
