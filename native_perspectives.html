       <h2>Native Perspectives</h2>

        <p>For Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Sioux communities, these events were 
            experiences of violence, loss, and broken trust. At Sand Creek, 
            many Native families believed they were under U.S. protection, 
            making the attack especially devastating.</p>

        <p>During the Great Sioux War, Native nations resisted to protect their land,
             resources, and way of life. Their actions were not acts of aggression, 
             but efforts to defend territory promised to them by earlier treaties.</p>

        <p>These conflicts increased Native distrust of the U.S. government and 
            showed that treaties often failed to provide real protection. The 
            effects of these events continued through forced relocation, reservation 
            life, and long-term cultural disruption.</p>
